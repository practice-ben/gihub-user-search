# Github Profile Search
This is a web app created in React. I used plain css to style the app. This was part of an exercise by freeCodeCamp's article on seven react projects for 2023.
## Challenges faced 
I experienced a challenge in setting and array of results obtained from the api. I was maintaining the async function and its associated variables outside the scope of the functional component. 
I was able to overcome this challenge by moving the variables and associated functions within the scope of the functional component.  

I also faced a challenge with loading of the searched github profiles after clicking the link. This produced an error "Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at inline (“script-src”)."
I was able to overcome the challenge by setting a target attribute of blank.
